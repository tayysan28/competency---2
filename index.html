	My name is Taylor Almeida and I'm going to school to get my Associate of Applied Science Degree, to become a User Expereince and User Interface designer, also known as UX/UI. I'm from Yona Guam, however I reside in Austin, Texas. I'm very passionate in art, fitness, and music. It helps me clear my mind and focus on the better things in life. 

	I spend alot of my time with my five year old son, by creating, drawing, swimming, watching movies, and rollder skating together. I enjoy working at American Airlines as a ramp agent. I am able to travel wherever and whenever I want to in this world. Seeing the world is exciting to me. I believe that, learning  about other people's cultures is important. It helps me to connect and understand how others are and how being different can be a beautiful thing.

	 <p>A girl who is stuck in an orphange home, hoping that her parents would come back one day. The movie, "Annie," the starring character, was miss treated by her caregiver, she was very passionate, hopeful, kind hearted yet had a fierce mind and made sure that everyone around her was taken care of. She always hoped that her original parents would come back for her, however as the time goes by, she recieves sad news that her parents passed away. By her surprise, she was blessed to be adopted by a stubborn, yet loving man, named Mr. Oliver Warbucks. He ends up adoring her and takes her underneath his wing to make sure to give her a loving and peaceful home.</p>
