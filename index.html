	<p class="paragraph">My name is Taylor Almeida and I'm going to school to get my Associate of Applied Science Degree, to become a User Expereince and User Interface designer, also known as UX/UI. I'm from Yona Guam, however I reside in Austin, Texas. I'm very passionate in art, fitness, and music. It helps me clear my mind and focus on the better things in life.</p><p> 

	I spend alot of my time with my five year old son, by creating, drawing, swimming, watching movies, and rollder skating together. I enjoy working at American Airlines as a ramp agent, for now. I'm able to travel wherever and whenever I want to in this world. Seeing the world is exciting to me. I believe that, learning  about other people's cultures is important. By doing so, it helps me to connect and understand how others are and how by being different can be a beautiful thing.

	<h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
	 <p>A girl who is stuck in an orphanage home, hoping that her parents would come back for her one day. The movie, "Annie," played by <strong>Aileen Quinn</strong> the starring character, was miss treated by her caregiver. Annie was very passionate, hopeful, kind hearted, and made sure that everyone around her was taken care of. However, she had a fierce mind with a brave heart and was very determined to sneak out of her oprhanage home to seek for her parents. As the time goes by, she recieves unsettlings news, that her parents passed away. By her surprise, she was blessed to be adopted by a very successful, stubborn, yet loving man, named Mr. Oliver Warbucks. Who had to learn that there is more to life than just money. He ends up adoring her and takes her underneath his wing to make sure to give her a loving and peaceful home.</p>
